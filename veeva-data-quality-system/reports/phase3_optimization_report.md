1. **Performance Indexes Applied**: 53 new specialized indexes
   - Contact validation optimization indexes
   - NPI validation indexes
   - Affiliation anomaly detection indexes
   - Cross-reference integrity indexes
   - Composite covering indexes

2. **SQLite Configuration Tuning**:
   ```sql
   PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;        -- Write-Ahead Logging
   PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;      -- Balanced durability/performance
   PRAGMA cache_size = -65536;       -- 64MB cache
   PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;       -- In-memory temporary tables
   PRAGMA mmap_size = 536870912;     -- 512MB memory mapping
   PRAGMA threads = 4;               -- Multi-threading support
   ```

### 🔍 **Query Optimizations**
1. **SQL Query Restructuring**:
   - Implemented CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries
   - Pre-computed conditions to avoid repeated evaluations
   - Early filtering with WHERE clauses
   - Optimized JOIN patterns and subquery elimination
   - Added LIMIT clauses to prevent excessive result sets

2. **Specific Query Improvements**:
