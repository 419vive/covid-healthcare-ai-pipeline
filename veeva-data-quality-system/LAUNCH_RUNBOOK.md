```

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Decision Criteria
**Trigger rollback if:**
- Critical system failures affecting >50% of functionality
- Error rates exceed 5% for more than 10 minutes
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Data corruption or loss detected

### Automated Rollback
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh production --rollback --immediate

# Restore from backup
./deploy/scripts/restore.sh --latest-stable --force
```

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. **Stop current services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Restore database**
   ```bash
   ./deploy/scripts/restore.sh pre-launch-backup.db.gz
   ```

3. **Deploy previous version**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

4. **Verify rollback success**
   ```bash
   ./deploy/scripts/monitor.sh health
   ```
